This is a project started in homage to [latethin](http://sui-hei.net) created by [kamisugi(上杉)](http://sui-hei.net/mondai/profile/1).

The name of `Cindy` stands for **Cindy Is Not Dead Yet**,
which comes from the popular original character of
[Cindy](http://sui-hei.net/app/webroot/pukiwiki/index.php?%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3).

Differences between Cindy
-------------------------
Cindy-Realtime inherit its database from [Cindy][1], but its frontend is completely different from [Cindy][1].

Cindy-Realtime has more features:
    - WebSocket, to make a realtime chat-like application
    - React, to UI more convenient, and more convenient for maintainance :smile:
    - GraphQL & Relay, instead of original REST-like API, to make site load faster.

Though it has some drawbacks:
    - Limited old browser support.
    - Unable to deploy on a single-thread PaaS.

For these reasons, I decide to separate this repository out from Cindy.
*Both repos are under support at now*.
